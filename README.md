# Demo
## Demo mini project-<<Alan's Universe>>
### This demo is a mini project of mine and also a project of Engineering Computation-24780. 
### I use the opengl to draw the static image in a single buffle and use the music sound visualization to realize the point of every sound trail.
### Every flash image is controled by the chrono time controler and use Fsleep to refresh the image. The whole demo time is controlled among 60s - 180s. And I set the time parameters to control the run time of every image.
### It's a cross-platform demo project. And written in C++ and use FsSimpleWindow and YsSimpleSound libraries. It is the flat directory structure. All the data files are directly in the directory where the program can access by FsChangeToProgramDir() function.
